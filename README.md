# react-env-extension
Guys, I created this little environment for developing browser extensions, I was studying the concept and this was the most stable and secure way to use [@reactjs](https://github.com/facebook/react/). I would greatly appreciate your opinions to optimize our extensions.

## Installation

* Install the dependencies
* Then add the build.sh permissions

```console
yarn install
chmod +x scripts/build.sh
```
